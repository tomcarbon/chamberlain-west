			<h2><center> THOMAS E. CHAMBERLAIN -- CV </center></h2>
			
			<p>Thomas Chamberlain has been an independent research scientist in theoretical physics since ~1970 and in mathematical psychology and economics (applied psychology) since 1981. Over this interval until recently he was employed as an engineer at Boeing, Raytheon, and other aerospace companies.</p>
			<p>In 1993 he finalized the canonical human behavior equation and in 1997 he began presenting papers at international economics conferences. His 2003 contribution “Does uneven expected risk promote poverty and instability?” provided the analytical basis or justification for international commerce damping and human recapitalization, two increasingly prominent 21st-century approaches for arresting and reversing the fateful concentration of wealth and income in a small percentage of the population. The related Discretionary-Power Principle of Justice was also introduced in the 2003 paper. More recently (2011) he has prepared a deeper mathematical system that unites neoclassical and Gossenian micro-economics, two systems in essential conflict since the Marginal Revolution of the 1870s.</p>
			<p>In physics his studies over the years focused on conceptualizing relativity and quantum mechanics (to the extent either may be possible). In 2012 he decided to concentrate on basic physics—suspending psychology and economics—with the goal of eventually uniting anisotropic (light-velocity) relativity and quantum theory. Because orthodox relativity rejects anisotropic light-velocity this effort immediately concentrated on special relativity to the neglect of quantum theory. In 2014 special relativity (and therefore general relativity) was found incomplete due to the isotropic c=constant postulate. The resulting paper “Fundamentally anisotropic light-velocity at the foundation of classical physics” was presented at the 2015 June AAAS-PD conference in San Francisco. (Original title changed).</p>
			
			<h3>Far-Field Gravitation</h3>
			<p>On the basis of a belief, from well before 2012, that one-way (near) infinite light-speed was crucially germane to deepening classical physics theory, almost immediately after the San Francisco conference (2015 July) he ascertained that Hubble expansion and Einstein’s same-motion acceleration (1907) are essentially related (in some manner)—inasmuch as equating the Hubble expansion, V=rH, to the similar expansion from S-M acceleration (in the limit V=c) with the latter as a free parameter yielded a=cH=6.3E-10 m/s2, which is within an order of Milgrom’s universal acceleration constant a0=1.2E-10 m/s2.</p>
			<p>Another nearly seven months (to 2016 February) were required to place Milgrom’s empirical Deep MOND on a relativistic basis (i.e., within “state-of-art” relativity physics, which extends standard relativity physics to formally recognize anisotropic light-speed—see Rizzi et al. (2008) and the AAAS-PD/San Francisco paper). Two new inductive advances enabled this theoretical advance: (1) conjunction of one-way infinite light-speed and the Hubble expansion to yield the corresponding time dilation; followed by (2) combining this time-dilation with its counterpart emerging from the Schwarzschild solution. The result was the relationship VL2=2(GM/rS)1/2(rHcH0)1/2 – departing from Milgrom’s functionally similar Vf2=(GMa0)1/2 by the Schwarzschild-based radius rS and the Hubble-expansion based rH, which, being equal, cancel out. (Note that VL is not Milgrom’s circular orbit speed Vf but rather the (also invariant) speed emerging from the linearized Lorentz transformation. The factor “2” had been mistakenly overlooked and was inserted as part of the previous revision on March 29, 2017.)</p>
			<p>Further developments over the next few months towards a complete deepening of the Einstein Field Equations were eventually suspended in order to prepare for the rapidly approaching AAAS-PD Conference in San Diego (14-17 June 2016), where the approximate formulation of Milgrom’s expression with comparison against astronomical “far-field” star and gas velocities was presented.</p>
			
			<h3>Accommodation of Far-Field Gravitation in the Schwarzschild Solution</h3>
			<p>The principal task in allowing completion of the paper has been establishing how the inverse-radius dependence of far-field gravitation emerges from the invariant far-field time-dilation d(Del-t')/dt=-(GMcH0)1/2/c2, a continuing task that began with the relation’s origination in 2016 February and was finally achieved in early November. Steady, non-accelerating Hubble expansion was the key permitting </p>
			<p>a = d[(GM/rS)(rHcH)]1/2/dr = - ½ (GMcH0)1/2/r  while  d[(GM/rS)(rHcH0)]1/2/dr=0.</p>
			<p> (Note that the factor “1/2” was initially overlooked and inserted as part of the previous revision on March 29, 2017. A significant consequence of this correction was a much-improved correspondence or agreement between Milgrom’s a0=1.2E-13 km/s2 and the present cH0/4≈1.6E-13 km/s2.)</p>
			<p>Additional concerns delayed the paper, but it was completed soon before traveling to the AAAS-PD conference in Hawaii with presentation on 22 June. The paper may be accessed in the “Selected Physics Papers” of this website.</p>
			
			<h3>Cosmic Acceleration/Deceleration</h3>
			<p>Milgrom’s universal acceleration constant is germane to both “dark matter” and “dark energy”, and we should expect follow-on insight into the latter problem. Here the salient factors are: (1) (inwardly singularly) anisotropic light speed; and (2) Hubble space expansion. Each factor by itself does not yield deeper relativity (i.e., as a scientific discipline), but taken together they give “empirical traction” that helps resolve both problems. Cosmic acceleration, in particular, may be related to time-dilation with increasing lookback-distance due to (again singular) anisotropic light speed within the Hubble flow.</p>
			<p>Initial aspects of this advance were given at the 29th International Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics in Cape Town (2017 December), with further developments presented at the APS April Meeting in Columbus, Ohio (2018 April). Additional advances relating "pure" cosmic acceleration to Newtonian/GRT plus subfield cosmic deceleration in the local universe were given at the Annual AAAS-PD Conference in Pomona, California (2018 June).</p>
