		<p><strong>THOMAS E. CHAMBERLAIN </strong><strong>--</strong><strong>CV</strong></p>
		<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SYNOPSIS</span></strong></p>
		<p>Thomas Chamberlain has been an independent research scientist in theoretical physics since ~1970 and in mathematical psychology and economics (applied psychology) since 1981. Over this interval until recently he was employed as an engineer at Boeing, Raytheon, and other aerospace companies.</p>
		<p>In 1993 he finalized the canonical human behavior equation and in 1997 he began presenting papers at international economics conferences. His 2003 contribution &ldquo;Does uneven expected risk promote poverty and instability?&rdquo; provided the analytical basis or justification for international commerce damping and human recapitalization, two increasingly prominent 21st-century approaches for arresting and reversing the fateful concentration of wealth and income in a small percentage of the population. The related Discretionary-Power Principle of Justice was also introduced in the 2003 paper. More recently (2011) he has prepared a deeper mathematical system that unites neoclassical and Gossenian micro-economics, two systems in essential conflict since the Marginal Revolution of the 1870s.</p>
		<p>In physics his studies over the years focused on conceptualizing relativity and quantum mechanics (to the extent either may be possible). In 2012 he decided to concentrate on basic physics&mdash;suspending psychology and economics&mdash;with the goal of eventually uniting anisotropic (light-velocity) relativity and quantum theory. Because orthodox relativity rejects anisotropic light-velocity this effort immediately concentrated on special relativity to the neglect of quantum theory. In 2014 special relativity (and therefore general relativity) was found incomplete due to the isotropic c=constant postulate. The resulting paper &ldquo;Fundamentally anisotropic light-velocity at the foundation of classical physics&rdquo; was presented at the 2015 June AAAS-PD conference in San Francisco. (Original title changed).</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Far-Field Gravitation</span></strong></p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the basis of a belief, from well before 2012, that one-way (near) infinite light-speed was crucially germane to deepening <em>classical</em> physics theory, almost immediately after the San Francisco conference (2015 July) he ascertained that Hubble expansion and Einstein&rsquo;s same-motion acceleration (1907) are essentially related (in some manner)&mdash;inasmuch as equating the Hubble expansion, V=rH, to the similar expansion from S-M acceleration (in the limit V=c) with the latter as a free parameter yielded a=cH=6.3E-10 m/s<sup>2</sup>, which is within an order of Milgrom&rsquo;s universal acceleration constant a<sub>0</sub>=1.2E-10 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another nearly seven months (2016 February) were required to derive Milgrom&rsquo;s expression for far-field star dynamics within &ldquo;state-of-art&rdquo; relativity physics (which extends standard relativity physics to formally recognize anisotropic light-speed&mdash;see Rizzi et al. (2008) and the AAAS-PD/San Francisco paper). Two new inductive advances enabled this theoretical advance: (1) conjunction of one-way infinite light-speed and the Hubble expansion to yield the corresponding time dilation; followed by (2) combining this time-dilation with its counterpart emerging from the Schwarzschild solution. The result was the relationship V<sub>f</sub><sup>2</sup>=(GM/r<sub>S</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>(r<sub>H</sub>cH<sub>0</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup> &ndash; departing from Milgrom&rsquo;s functionally equivalent V<sub>f</sub><sup>2</sup>=(GMa<sub>0</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup> by the Schwarzschild-based radius r<sub>S</sub> and the Hubble-expansion based r<sub>H</sub>, which, being equal, cancel out.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further developments over the next few months towards a complete deepening of the Einstein Field Equations were eventually suspended in order to prepare for the rapidly approaching AAAS-PD Conference in San Diego (14-17 June 2016), where the derivation of Milgrom&rsquo;s expression with comparison against astronomical &ldquo;far-field&rdquo; star and gas velocities was presented.</p>
